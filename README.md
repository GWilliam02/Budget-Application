# Budgeting App

## Introduction
This application seeks to allow users to calculate their monthly expenditure by 
recording their daily expenses.  For each expense, users will be able to state 
the date of purchase, the category it falls under, and whether it is an abnormal
purchase or not. Each of the expenses will be displayed in a list with features 
to sort the list according to categories or price. Each recorded expense can be 
edited or deleted, and users can set up recurring expenses. There will also be a 
balance indicating  how much money the user has left in their 
pre-set budget, after subtracting all expenses. There will be a feature to split bills with people 
and records how much money other people owe the user. Users can also create a savings goal
where they contribute a set amount of money each month towards that goal.

The application is designed for university students or people that need to manage their
spending habits.

I have a tendency to overspend when I don't keep track of my expenses. But after trying multiple 
budgeting methods to no avail, I decided to create my own application to keep track of my own expenses, with
features that I feel are important for planning future budgeting plans.
